Making Magic (chosen idea probably):
- user makes 4(?) spells (sets the name)
- 3(?) types of spells (flame, spark, splash) 
- each spell is strong, medium, weak (can only have one strong spell, unless gamemode set to overpowered) (picks from a random change for exact power level), spell power determines how many times you are allowed to use each spell in the fights
- allow for added effects (attack change, defense change, heal, multi-hit)
- possibly choose to fight swarm of foes or do a bossfight (only do bossfight if I get lazy) after making all your spells


strength: parameter varible in constructor
make logic involving type with getter methods
figure out how to use enums

dragon class is in u5t4-5

plan:
1) make spellEffect class
2) finsh menuing
3) make spell class
4) test to make sure all the stuff is made correctly
5) make enemy class (use dragon class from prevois lab for ideas)
6) make fighting enemy class
7) make class that connects maker and fighting class
8) hopefully finsh
